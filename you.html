    <h1>Settimeout in ES6</h1>
    <img src="carbon (5).png"/>
    <p>The variable i is declared in the for loop and is incremented from 0 till i is less than 20. So when we are printing i, the values of i from 0 to 19 are printed</p>
    <p>In the setTimeout function, the value of i which is 20 is printed for 20 times at an interval of 1 sec.</p>

    <p>Here in this example, the variable i is defined using let, the output for the block in the for loop is printed from 0 to 19.</p>
    <p>In the setTimeout function, the value of i is printed from 0 to 19 at an interval of 1 sec. It so because it is creating a new block everytime and for every new block it is taking the new value of i.</p>
